	<h1>Time, Space,Complexity</h1>
	<p>To express the Time complexity of an algorithm, we use something called the “Big O notation”. The Big O notation is a language we use to describe the Time complexity of an algorithm. It’s how we compare the efficiency of different approaches to a problem, and helps us to make decisions.</p>
	<p>This means that the amount of memory used by the algorithm increases linearly with the size of the input. An example of an algorithm with O(n) <b>space complexity</b> is reversing a linked list, which requires creating a new linked list with the same number of nodes as the original.</p>
